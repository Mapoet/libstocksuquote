Version 0.5.0

	"\r\n" string.
	(2000/04/09)

	have volume. Now, get_history_csv function does not return an error
	when it does not find a volume.

	function. The process has been changed.

	get historical quotes for one stock.

	Symbol, Name, Time and Date are now dynamically allocated.
	This minimizes the stock structure size.

	tested in download_stocks function.

	function.
